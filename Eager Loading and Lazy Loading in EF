Eager Loading:
--------------
It is a process of loading related entites before you access them.
Ex:
var authorsWithBooks = dbContext.Authors
                .Include(author => author.Books)
                .ToList();

// Here "Author" and "Books" where two entites. Author can have one or more books

Lazy Load:
---------
Lazy loading it is a process of calling entities on demand whenever we required.

where we will execute separate queries.

Ex:
//Lazy Load only Departments
            var students = objDept.Where(d =>d.DepId == 1).FirstOrDefault();

            //Load employees based on department whenever we need
            var emp = objEmp.Where(e => e.DeptId == students.DepId).ToList();

            foreach (var item in emp)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
            }

Common problems:
1)Performance issue
2)Overfetching of data

Explicit Loading:
----------------
When you dont have ability to lazy load entitties. If this is disabled.

In that situations still we can achieve lazy load using Exaplicit loading.
We will call load() explicitly whenever we required.

var ex = dbContext.Students.ToList().Load();
